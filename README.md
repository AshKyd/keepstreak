# Keep Streak!
A goal tracking app to let you keep a watchful eye on your good/bad
habits. Give up smoking, read a book, do a good deed. Keep Streak
incentivizes doing the right thing.

# State
This is a little project to familiarise myself with AngularJS,
Firefox OS and d3. This is a #campjs project.

You should be able to simply run index.html in any browser to use the
app.

# Development
I'm still working on features. Pull requests welcome.

You'll note a bunch of dead libraries in there, I'm planning on adding a
calendar view and stats down the track but I'm probably not going to
have time this weekend.
